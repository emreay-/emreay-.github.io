              <h1>Congratz, you made your journey on the internet all the way up to this website!</h1>
              <h1>So briefly;</h1>
              <p>
                  I'm an engineer who is currently working as a software developer at a start-up in Oxford, UK. I have
                  quite a multi-disciplinary background merging aspects of CS and EE. I recently finished my master's
                  studies at KTH Royal Institute of Technology in Systems, Control and Robotics program.
              </p>

              <p>
                Before that, I was studying Control Engineering at Istanbul Technical University.
              </p>
              <h1>I'm interested;</h1>
              <p>
                  In computer science, mobile robotics, computer vision and related areas. I like to work on both
                  hardware and software. However, my current career path is more on the software side.
              </p>

              <h1>What else?</h1>
              <p>
                  I've been playing guitar for years and even composing.
